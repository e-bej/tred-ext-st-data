\section*{Idioms}
Even ``non-compositional'' idioms are actually (originaly) metaphorical or methonymical.  Even though sometimes it is hard to see that. At other times a speaker may forget that rather straightforward metaphoric aspect:

\section{PDT 2.0}\label{PDT}
In PDT there are several functors that refer to multiword expressions (MWEs) in one way or another. There are also some technical lemmas (??? nebo jen 1?) like {\tt \#Forn} that identify roots of subtrees representing MWE's.

There are currently two graphical search engines for PDT: Netgraph \cite{netgraph} and TrEd \cite{tred}. Both have their respective benefits, but since TrEd is considerably faster due to its use of an SQL database backend \cite{pmltq}, we have used TrEd for all the examples in this work. We also give the search queries using the PML Tree Query language \cite{pmltq} where appropriate.

\subsection{Foreign Phrase: \code{t-node [t\_lemma = \#Forn]}}\label{PDT:Forn}
Foreign Phrase seems to be overused and its overuse seems a bit arbitrary. \\
- jmena firem jsou nekdy forn, nekdy ne. (dohledat)\\

%%
\subsubsection{Foreign phrases with just one t-node}
There are 34 occurrences of this construction in the PDT~2.0. Counting them is as easy as writing a query in Figure~\ref{fig:tq-forn1} and extending it with this filter: \code{>>count(\$n)}.

\caption{PML-TQ search query for single-node foreing phrases}
\label{fig:tq-forn1}
\end{wrapfigure}

In case of the bibliographic reference in Figure~\ref{fig:forn-biblio} there is coordination of three foreign phrases corresponding to the parts of a bibliographic reference annotated, but the reason for this is not very clear. After all, the point of annotating foreign phrases as simple lists with a \code{\#Forn} node as a head was to make no assumptions about these pieces of a text \pageref{pdt-t-man:300}.  \\
- je to kvuli te interpunkci???

Names of companies seem to be distinguished more by the country of origin then by any linguistic reasons, as demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:forn-firmy}. As far as linguistic criteria are concerned, Chemapol and Inekon are as foreign as Agip or Total. However the first two are, or at least were%
\footnote{At the time of writing this thesis Chemapol is owned by another international company, which only emphasises vagueness of this distinction} %
%
, Czech companies, while those in the latter group have a foreign origin.

\subsection{CPHR}
There are 76 occurrences of {\tt CPHR} nodes, whose head verb is not its parent, but only effective parent, in 40 sentences. See Figure~\ref{fig:tq-echild} for the query and Figures~\ref{fig:cphr-echild} and~\ref{fig:cphr-echild2} for examples.

Figure~\ref{fig:cphr-echild2} shows on the other hand a coordination of two V-N idioms with the same verbal part.

\section{Notes}

{\em``Prokopnout pětku''} -- prokopnout [trestný kop after scoring] pětka -- ellipsis crossing into pragmatics(?), because it is {\em not} an ellipsis of some exact linguistic construction, but rather an ellipsis of a situation which everyone in the discourse understand.  

``Návrh / novela Zákona na ochranu osobních údajů''  $$((\mathrm{návrh} \lor \mathrm{novela}) | \mathrm{zákon} \lor \mathrm{předpis})$$
-- lexikální funkce?? \citep{wanner} ?

\subsection{Missing t-nodes in \code{coord}s}
``\textit{První} a druhá světová válka'' apod. -- the word ``První'' is an ellipsis of ``První světová válka''. The ellided t-nodes that should had been newly established were not, however, which left us two options, either annotate a single-word (and single-node) expression as an instance of a multi-word lexeme, or annotate the words ``světová válka'' that occure in the text as being a part of both expressions. We decided for the first, because the agreement on ellipses is fairly high in this type of coordinations.
