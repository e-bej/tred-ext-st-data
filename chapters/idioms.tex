\chapter{Idioms}
Even ``non-compositional'' idioms are actually (originaly) metaphorical or methonymical.  Even though sometimes it is hard to see that. At other times a speaker may forget that rather straightforward metaphoric aspect:

\begin{quote}
Barack Obama accused his Republican rivals of stirring a controversy over a comment he made about putting “lipstick on a pig.” \emph{(NY~Times, 11.~September 2008)}
\end{quote}

\section{Sinclair}
Patrick Hanks gives a very succinct introduction to John Sinclair's \citep{sinclair:wiki} view of a lexical unit and meaning distinctions. It is closely related to Hanks' own work, as we cen see in \citet{hanks:norms}.

\section{Žabokrtský}
Zdeněk Žabokrtský defines a \emph{lexeme} in his doctoral thesis \citep{zabokrtsky:2005a}, as well as several other basic concepts that he requires for precise description of his work on valency lexicon of Czech verbs. His definition is based on the concept of lexeme as defined in works of \citet{cermak:91} and \citet{filipec:1994} and a concept of lexical unit as defined by \citet{cruse:1986}\footnote{Žabokrský cites \citealp{verspoor:1997}'s description of Cruse's lexeme, but that makes no diference {\xxx(check!)}}. Žabokrtský's view seems to differ from the view of the above mentioned authors, but that difference deserves some analysis.

Žabokrtský defines a lexeme as ``an ordered pair which couples the set of lexical forms and the set of lexical units''. This way a definition of lexeme is based on a definition of the concepts ``lexical form'' and ``lexical unit''. It is also implied that these are somehow complementary. 

A lexeme is however a relativelly common concept in lexicography. It has been defined at least by Lyons, by Cruse, Čermák, Filipec, and probably by many other authors. What is common to all of these definitions is that they construe lexeme as a unit consisting of some lexical form and meaning. 
\emph{It is in fact interesting to try to find what distinguishes a concept of lexeme from a concept of concept itself! It seems that a conncept is also a meaning (essentia) with a form.} See \citet{materna:1998,stranak:2001} for detailed discussion of definition of concepts as well as thorough explanation (in the latter) of the reasons why we do not delve into the problem of concept itself too deeply: it is out of the methodological reach of modern science as we understand it: the problem of what is a concept cannot be solved by any conceptual analysis.

A \emph{lexical unit} in turn is used as defined by Verspoor referring to \citet{cruse:1986}.\footnote%
