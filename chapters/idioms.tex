\chapter{Idioms}
Even ``non-compositional'' idioms are actually (originally) metaphorical or metonymical.  Even though sometimes it is hard to see that. At other times a speaker may forget that rather straightforward metaphoric aspect:

\begin{quote}
Barack Obama accused his Republican rivals of stirring a controversy over a comment he made about putting “lipstick on a pig.” \emph{(NY~Times, 11.~September 2008)}

\section{MWE}

\citet{baldwin:2004} defines MWEs very broadly as entities that are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
``decomposable into multiple simplex words,'' and
\item
``lexically, syntactically, semantically, pragmatically and/or statistically idiosyncratic.''
\end{itemize}

His examples are as follows: \emph{``San Francisco, ad hoc, by and large, Where Eagles Dare, kick the bucket, part of speech, in step, the Oakland Raiders, trip the light fantastic, telephone box, call (someone) up, take a walk, do a number on (someone), take (unfair) advantage (of), pull strings, kindle excitement, fresh air, \ldots''}

From the definition and the examples it is clear that Baldwin includes not only idioms and complex verbs, but also any named entities and even any statistically or pragmatically important\footnote{We avoid a MWE (sic!) ``statistically significant'' on purpose, because we assume that Baldwin also avoids it on purpose when using a word ``idiosyncratic''. As far as we know ``statistically idiosyncratic'' is not a well defined term byt we understand it as saying that not any statistically significant difference in distribution is peculiar enough to be called ``idiosyncratic''. We are fully aware how imprecise this sounds.} collocations. At least that is what we understand as ``statistically idiosyncratic''. Such expressions include ``environmental policy'' but also ``salt and pepper'', which is semantically quite compositional and simple, but statistically the order of its components is significant. In the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA, \url{http://www.americancorpus.org/}), there are 3648 occurrences of ``salt and pepper'' vs. 62 occurrences of ``pepper and salt''. Of the 62 occurrences 60 are in recipes. This is rather extreme case of ``statistical idiosyncrasy''; as such it well illustrates the point.

Such a broad definition basically says that MWEs are ``interesting collocations'' but in its broadness it is not suitable for our purpose. Since we base our work on the concept of (monosemic) lexeme, we are more interested in the more conventional approach that Baldwin has in most of his other (co-authored) papers \citep{baldwin:2003,sag:2002}. MWEs are viewed as ``cohesive lexemes that cross word boundaries''. This seems to be the most common definition of MWEs in NLP, as long as we abstract from subtle differences in terminology \citep{calzolari, copestake, dalsi?}. \xxx{je to taky shodne s tradicnimi lingvisty?
