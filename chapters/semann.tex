\label{sec:seman}
The annotation tool \seman\ is witten in Perl 5. It is composed of several parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item A frontend loads an \sf, a \semlex,  and a log file for this \sf, if it had already been annotated. 
\item \ntred\ backend that is used to 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item generate surface sentences from tectogrammatical trees in \tf{}s that are then displayed in the \seman\ GUI,
	\item perform all the on-the fly preannotations (\Sref{sec:preannot})
	\end{itemize}
\item A \semlex\ module is used to read, save, and edit \semlex.
\item There is of course also a suite of miscelaneous scripts mostly for validation of annotated data, comparing and merging multiple annotations, merging annotators' \semlex{}es and computing reliability of annotations.
\end{itemize}
