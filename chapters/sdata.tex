\subsection{The design and the PML schema}
sdata means s-files PML files and the PML schema of these files. The idea behind sdata design is to have a simple way to store additional ``sense'' annotations over any layer of PDT. The annotations are stored as a set of ``sense'' nodes where each s-node contains a link to a sense repository (annotation dictionary) and a set of references to nodes (m-, a- or t-) that correspond to an instance of the sense. The s-file is thus basically a very simple flat list of s-nodes.
