This is an extension to the tree editor TrEd
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~pajas/tred/). Extensions are described
here: http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~pajas/tred/ar01s17.html

It allows to visualise and search for multiword-expressions and named entities
(or anything else that somebody annotates) in the PML st-files. st-files
contain additional annotations on top of t-layer of PDT 2.0
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt2.0/). 

This repository was originally a subdirectory of my Ph.D. thesis repository
that was not and is not public. Thus the commit logs are in Czech, since at the
time of writing they were intended only for myself. Also sometimes the logs are
about things that are part of the larger private thesis repository, but are not
part of this repository. I am sorry about the inconvenience.
