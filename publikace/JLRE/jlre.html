           </p><!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   Various projects involving lexico-semantic annotation have been
           ongoing for many years. Among those there are the projects of word
           sense annotation, usually for creating training data for word sense
           disambiguation. However majority of these projects have only annotated
           very limited number of word senses (cf. Kilgarriff <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xkilgarriff:1998">1998</a>)</span>). Even among
                                                                                                        

                                                                                                        
           those that aim towards &#8220;all words&#8221; word-sense annotation, multiword
           expressions (MWE) are not annotated adequately (see Mihalcea&#x00A0;<span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xmihalcea:1998">1998</a>)</span>
           or Haji&#x010D; et al.&#x00A0;<span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xhajic-cwn:04">2004</a>)</span>), because for their successful annotation a
           methodology allowing identification of new MWEs during annotation is
           required. Existing dictionaries that include MWEs concentrate only on
           the most frequent ones, but we argue that there are many more
           MWEs that can only be identified (and added to the dictionary) by
           annotation.
           </p><!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   There are various projects for identification of named entities (for an
           overview see &#352;ev&#x010D;íková et al.&#x00A0;<span class="cite">(<a

           Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-8r2">2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:intro --></a>) why we consider named entities to be concerned with lexical
           meaning. At this place we just wish to recall that these projects
           only select some specific parts of text and provide information only
           for these. They do not aim for full lexico-semantic annotation of
           texts.
           </p><!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   There is also another group of projects that have to tackle the problem of
           lexical meaning, namely treebanking projects that aim to develop a deeper
           layer of annotation in addition to a surface syntactic layer. This
           deeper layer is generally agreed to concern lexical meaning. Therefore

           <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xhajic:2005">2005</a>)</span>), which is a large corpus with rich annotation on three layers: it has
           in addition to the morphological and the surface syntactic layers also the
           tectogrammatical layer. (In fact, there is also one non-annotation layer,
           representing the &#8220;raw-text&#8221; segmented into documents, paragraphs, and
           tokens.) Annotation of a sentence on the morphological layer consists of
           attaching several attributes to the tokens of the w-layer, the most important
           of which are morphological lemma and tag. A sentence at the analytical
           layer is represented as a rooted ordered tree with labeled nodes. The
           dependency relation between two nodes is captured by an edge with a
           functional label. The tectogramatical layer has been construed as the
           layer of the (literal) meaning of the sentence and thus should be

           form nodes in a tree (t-nodes). Synsemantic (function) words are
           represented by various attributes of t-nodes. Each t-node has a
           lemma: an attribute whose value is the node&#8217;s basic lexical form.
           Currently t-nodes, and consequently their t-lemmas, are still visibly
           derived from the morphological division of text into tokens. This
           preliminary handling has always been considered unsatisfactory in

           distinguish also a special type of MWEs, for which we are mainly interested in

           syntactic functions are more or less arbitrary inside a NE (consider an
           address with phone numbers, etc.) and so is the assignment of semantic
           roles. That is why we need each NE to be combined into a single node, just
           like we do it with MWEs in general.

           layer of PDT 2.0 the t-lemmas that correspond to lexias have
           been basically identified for all the verbs and some nouns and
           adjectives. The resulting valency lexicon is called PDT-VALLEX
           <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xhajic:2003">Haji&#x010D; et&#x00A0;al., 2003</a>)</span> and we can see it as a repository of lexias
           based on verbs, adjectives and nouns in PDT that have valency.

           However in the current state it is not fully sufficient even for verbs, mainly
           because parts of MWEs are not joined into one node. Parts of frames
           marked as idiomatic are still represented by separate t-nodes in a
           tectogrammatical tree (e.g. nodes with t-lemmas <span

           also for agreement on a t-node not being a part of a MWE, i.e. not tagged
           at all. This allows us to positively discriminate the cases where annotators
           agree that a t-node is not a part of a MWE from the cases where one
           annotator annotates a t-node and the other one does not, which is evidently
           worse.
