The texts included in Semcor were extracted from the Brown corpus and then linked to senses in the WordNet lexicon. All the words in the corpus have been sintactically tagged using Brill's part of speech tagger; the semantical tagging was done manually for all the nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, each of these words being associated with its corrispondent WordNet sense. To codify the data tagged data, an SGML file format has been used.}}

	Annote = {This marks the outcome of an unusual collaborative effort by leading scholars of two distinguished linguistic traditions, combining formal and functional approaches to semantics. Eva Hajicov{\'a} and Petr Sgall are the leaders of the most `formal' branch of the contemporary functional Prague School tradition, while Barbara H. Partee is one of the founders of formal semantics and one of its leading contributors. In this work the authors jointly explore the relationship between theories of topic-focus structure, principally as developed in the Prague School, and the tripartite structure approach to quantification and other focus-sensitive constructions which has emerged from work in formal semantics by Heim, Kamp, Rooth, Partee, Von Finkel, Krifka, and others. 
The book provides a brief introduction to the most relevant aspects of both traditions, then proceeds through a dialogue between the two approaches, culminating in a synthesis in which a set of jointly developed hypotheses are examined and applied to a broad range of examples. 
The book will be of interest to researchers and advanced students in semantics, pragmatics, comparative English-Slavic structure, semantic typology, computational linguistics, and general linguistics theory.}}

	Abstract = {The rapid growth of the Web has made itself a huge and valuable knowledge base. Among them, biographical information is of great interest to society. However, there has not been an efficient and complete approach to automated biography creation by querying the web. This paper describes an automatic web-based question answering system for biographical queries. Ad-hoc improvements on pattern learning approaches are proposed for mining biographical knowledge. Using bootstrapping, our approach learns surface text patterns from the web, and applies the learned patterns to extract relevant information. To reduce human labeling cost, we propose a new IDF-inspired re- ranking approach and compare it with pattern's precision- based re-ranking approach. A comparative study of the two re-ranking models is conducted. The tested system produces promising results for answering biographical queries}}

	Year = {2006},
	Abstract = {There are at least two kinds of similarity. Relational similarity is correspondence between relations, in contrast with attributional similarity, which is correspondence between attributes. When two words have a high degree of attributional similarity, we call them synonyms. When two pairs of words have a high degree of relational similarity, we say that their relations are analogous. For example, the word pair mason:stone is analogous to the pair carpenter:wood. This article introduces Latent Relational Analysis (LRA), a method for measuring relational similarity. LRA has potential applications in many areas, including information extraction, word sense disambiguation, and information retrieval. Recently the Vector Space Model (VSM) of information retrieval has been adapted to measuring relational similarity, achieving a score of 47% on a collection of 374 college-level multiple-choice word analogy questions. In the VSM approach, the relation between a pair of words is characterized by a vector of frequencies of predefined patterns in a large corpus. LRA extends the VSM approach in three ways: (1) The patterns are derived automatically from the corpus, (2) the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to smooth the frequency data, and (3) automatically generated synonyms are used to explore variations of the word pairs. LRA achieves 56% on the 374 analogy questions, statistically equivalent to the average human score of 57%. On the related problem of classifying semantic relations, LRA achieves similar gains over the VSM.}}

	Title = {Functional morphology},
	Year = {2004},
	Abstract = { This paper presents a methodology for implementing natural language morphology in the functional language Haskell. The main idea behind is simple: instead of working with untyped regular expressions, which is the state of the art of morphology in computational linguistics, we use finite functions over hereditarily finite algebraic datatypes. The definitions of these datatypes and functions are the language-dependent part of the morphology. The language-independent part consists of an untyped dictionary format which is used for synthesis of word forms, and a decorated trie, which is used for analysis.Functional Morphology builds on ideas introduced by Huet in his computational linguistics toolkit Zen, which he has used to implement the morphology of Sanskrit. The goal has been to make it easy for linguists, who are not trained as functional programmers, to apply the ideas to new languages. As a proof of the productivity of the method, morphologies for Swedish, Italian, Russian, Spanish, and Latin have already been implemented using the library. The Latin morphology is used as a running example in this article.},

This grammatical formalism entails that the lexical entry for each word contain both semantic and syntactic feature structures. In the feature structure of a phrasal head, we encode syntactic and semantic constraints on grammatical phrasal patterns in terms of thematic structures, and encode the precedence relations in terms of adjunct structures. Such feature structures denote partial information which defines the set of legal phrases. They also provide sufficient information to identify thematic roles. With this formalism, parsing and thematic analysis can be achieved simultaneously. Due to the simplicity and flexibility of Information-based Case Grammar, context dependent and discontinuous relations such as agreements, coordinations, long-distance dependencies, and control and binding, can be easily expressed. ICG is a kind of unification-based formalism. Therefore it inherits the advantages of unification-based formalisms and more.},

We argue in this paper that so-called ontologies present their own methodological and architectural peculiarities: on the methodological side, their main peculiarity is the adoption of a highly interdisciplinary approach, while on the architectural side the most interesting aspect is the centrality of the role they can play in an information system, leading to the perspective of ontology-driven information systems.}}

Error analysis suggests several key factors behind this surprising finding, including inherent limitations of current statistical MT architectures.},

	Abstract = {The paper is divided in three chapters: 

* Chapter I supplies the introductory information: auxiliary notions, basic assumptions our discussion is based on, and detailed illustrations of linguistic representations proposed. 

* Chapter II discusses the three major types of linguistic dependency: semantic, syntactic, and morphological. After formulating the definitions, the properties of each type of dependency are described in parallel, their subtypes are specified, and a review of their 14 possible combinations in a sentence is presented. 

* Chapter III concentrates on syntactic dependency. Four current fallacies concerning syntactic dependency are analyzed, and eight case studies are given---to illustrate the effect of our criteria for establishing syntactic dependencies. A cursory comparison with constituency representation follows; the cases in which 'pure' syntactic dependency proves to be insufficient are discussed. The chapter ends with remarks on the use of syntactic dependency in computational linguistics. },

	Abstract = {As software becomes more and more complex, it is more and more important to structure it well. Well-structured software is easy to write, easy to debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be re-used to reduce future programming costs. Conventional languages place conceptual limits on the way problems can be modularised. Functional languages push those limits back. In this paper we show that two features of functional languages in particular, higher-order functions and lazy evaluation, can contribute greatly to modularity. As examples, we manipulate lists and trees, program several numerical algorithms, and implement the alpha-beta heuristic (an algorithm from Artificial Intelligence used in game-playing programs). Since modularity is the key to successful programming, functional languages are vitally important to the real world.},
	Annote = {This paper dates from 1984, and circulated as a Chalmers memo for many years. Slightly revised versions appeared in 1989 and 1990 in the Computer Journal and the Year of Programming. This version is based on the original Chalmers memo nroff source, lightly edited for LaTeX and to bring it closer to the published versions. Please excuse the slightly old-fashioned type-setting, and the fact that the examples are not in Haskell!}}
